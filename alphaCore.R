#' alphaCore ranking of nodes in a complex, directed network
#'
#' \code{alphaCore} returns a node ranking of a graph
#'
#' Iteratively computes a node ranking based on a feature set derived from
#' edge attributes and optionally static node features using the
#' mahalanobis data depth function at the origin.
#'
#' @param input_graph An igraph object of a directed graph
#' @param featureComputeFun A function that converts a node's edges (with
#'   attributes) into node features. Default computes in-degree and strength
#' @param stepSize defines the stepsize of each iteration as percentage of node count
#' @param startEpsilon the epsilon to start with. Removes all nodes with depth>epsilon at start
#' @param exponentialDecay dynamically reduces the step size, to have high cores with few nodes
#' @return A dataframe of node name and alpha value indicating the ranking
